'''Recursion is a function which calls itself it is used to directly use a mathematical formula
as a function.For example 
         
         factorial(n) = n*factorial(n-1)
         This function can be defined as follows:
         
         def factorilal(n)
         if i == 0 or i == 1
                       return 1 
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)
            
        '''


# n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4...*n
# n = 3
# product = 1
# for i in range(n):
#     product = product * (i+1)
    
# print(product)
